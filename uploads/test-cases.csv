1,## Test Plan: Document Creation and Management
2,
3,**1. Introduction**
4,
5,"This document outlines the test plan for a document creation and management system, based on the provided Business Requirements Document (BRD) snippets.  The snippets indicate the system handles `.docx` files, suggesting a Microsoft Word-compatible document editor.  Testing will focus on core functionality and data integrity.  Further details in a complete BRD would refine this plan."
6,
7,**2. Test Objectives**
8,
9,* Verify the creation of new documents.
10,* Verify the saving and loading of documents.
11,* Validate data integrity during save/load operations.
12,* Confirm the proper functioning of embedded styles and numbering.
13,* Check for compatibility with standard Microsoft Word features (implied).
14,* Assess the system's handling of various file sizes (to be determined based on complete BRD).
15,"* Identify any potential security vulnerabilities (if applicable, based on complete BRD)."
16,
17,**3. Test Scope**
18,
19,"This test plan covers the core functionalities of document creation, saving, loading, and basic styling. It does *not* cover advanced features (e.g., collaboration, version control, specific formatting options)  unless explicitly detailed in the full BRD."
20,
21,**4. Test Methodology**
22,
23,This testing will employ a combination of:
24,
25,* **Functional Testing:**  Verifying that the system performs as specified in the BRD.
26,* **Data Integrity Testing:** Ensuring data is accurately saved and retrieved without corruption.
27,"* **Compatibility Testing:**  Checking compatibility with standard document formats (e.g., .docx)."
28,* **Regression Testing:**  Retesting after bug fixes or feature additions.
29,
30,**5. Test Data**
31,
32,Test data will include:
33,
34,* Empty documents.
35,* Documents with simple text.
36,"* Documents with various formatting (bold, italic, underline, different fonts, paragraph styles, numbered/bulleted lists)."
37,* Documents containing images (if image handling is a feature - needs clarification from full BRD).
38,* Documents of varying sizes (size range to be defined).
39,
40,**6. Test Environment**
41,
42,"* Operating Systems: Windows 10, macOS (latest versions), potentially Linux (to be determined based on full BRD)."
43,* Hardware:  Standard PC configurations.
44,* Software:  The document creation and management system under test.

46,**7. Test Cases**
47,
48,| Test Case ID | Test Case Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail | Notes |
49,|---|---|---|---|---|---|
50,| TC_001 | Create a new blank document | A new blank document is created successfully. |  |  | Verify file size and content. |
51,| TC_002 | Save a new document | The document is saved successfully to the specified location. |  |  | Verify file can be opened with Word. Check file size. |
52,| TC_003 | Load a saved document | The document is loaded successfully and displays the correct content and formatting. |  |  | Verify content and formatting match saved document. |
53,"| TC_004 | Save and Load a document with formatted text (bold, italic, underline) | Formatting is preserved during save and load operations. |  |  |  |"
54,| TC_005 | Save and Load a document with numbered/bulleted lists | Numbering and bulleting styles are preserved. |  |  |  |
55,| TC_006 | Save and Load a large document (size to be determined) | Document loads without errors or data corruption. |  |  | Measure load time. |
56,| TC_007 | Create document with images (if applicable) | Images are displayed correctly. |  |  | Verify image quality and resolution. |

58,
59,**8. Test Schedule**
60,
61,"(To be determined based on the scope and resources available.)  Includes planning, execution, defect reporting, and retesting."
62,
63,**9. Risk Assessment**
64,
65,* **Incomplete BRD:** Lack of complete specifications may delay testing and impact test coverage.
66,* **Unforeseen Bugs:** The discovery of critical bugs might require adjustments to the schedule.
67,"* **Resource Constraints:** Limited resources (testers, hardware) may extend the testing timeline."
68,
69,**10. Exit Criteria**
70,
71,* All test cases are executed.
72,* All critical and high-priority bugs are fixed and retested.
73,* A defined percentage of medium and low-priority bugs are addressed (percentage to be defined).
74,* Test coverage meets pre-defined requirements.
75,
76,**11. Reporting**
77,
78,"A test summary report will be generated after test execution, including pass/fail rates, bug reports, and overall system stability assessment.  Regular progress reports will be provided during the testing phase."
79,
80,
81,This test plan is a starting point. A complete BRD is needed to fully define the scope and requirements for a comprehensive testing process.  The test cases above need to be expanded upon considerably to cover all anticipated functionality.
